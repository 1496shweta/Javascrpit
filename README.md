Setting up the environment 
Let_Var_Const 
Use var if you need function scope or hoisting (though it's recommended to avoid it in modern code).
Use let for variables that may be reassigned within the same block.
Use const for variables that should not be reassigned after their initial assignment.
prefer no to use var because of issue in block scope and Functional Scope
