// Varible ka type kya ha- JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. This means that the type of a variable is determined at runtime, and you can change the type of a variable during the execution of a program. In contrast, statically typed languages determine variable types at compile-time, and the type of a variable is fixed once it is declared.
